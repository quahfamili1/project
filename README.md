# Hdb finder
This project was a group work by 4 students who are learning how to develop react app. 

## App description
The app provides users with latest hdb sales data and allow users to find the average transacted price of the area of interest. 

### Users stories
#### Implemented features
* As a user, I want to be able to input the location of the property I'm interested in so that I can receive an accurate average price based on property type (e.g., apartment, house, condo) for that area.
* As a user, I want to see the location plotted on map so I know which areas are suitable to my filter
* As a user, I want to be able to filter the average price results based on specific criteria such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or square footage.
* As a user, I want the app to display a list of last 10 historical data on property prices in the area so that I can track trends and make informed decisions.

#### Future implementation
* As a user, I want the app to provide insights into factors that may influence property prices in a particular area, such as nearby schools, public transportation, or crime rates.
* As a user, I want the option to save my favorite areas and properties for quick access and comparison in the future.
* As a user, I want to be able to share the average property prices with others via social media or messaging platforms.
* As a user, I want to see histogram before applying my filter so I can see the trend (like airbnb filter)
* As a user, I want to compare 2 areas on the same page
